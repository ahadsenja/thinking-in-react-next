This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). 
#### This project resource
resource: https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react

## Introduction
I just follow the tutorial from the https://react.dev site, and i just make it a bit different in my code. 
Actually, as long as i know, this project was focus on State, Props and how data flow works in react/next app.

So, what i do in this project that can make it a bit different from the tutorial?
  - I move every component into different files. 
  - I placed the dummy data into another file.
  - I create the interface file to store every interface for every component that have more then equal to 2 props,
    so the component function will be more clean.
  - I use this interface to set and store the type of props.

Oke, I know you want to go to the code faster, so here are a few steps that you need to do
if you want to follow this simple app tutorial.

## Getting Started
  Just follow every steps carefully and slowly to get understand, what is actually happened in this simple app.

### Cloning project
1. First, clone this project via ssh: ```git clone git@github.com:ahadsenja/thinking-in-react-next.git```.
2. If you want to download this project, or use HTTPS or another way, just go to this project repository 
  and choose from "code selectbox".
3. After finish to clone this project, just enter to the project directory.
4. Install the dependencies or requirement packages, you can choose one of this varous way: <br>
   ```bash
   npm install 
   # or 
   yarn install
   ```

### Run the app
choose one of all the way below and run it in the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

<strong>*Notice:</strong> if you placed an attention at 'pnpm' package above, actually it doesn't matter, but if you are a beginner like me, 
i just recommend you to use the 'npm' or 'yarn' package.

### Show the app in browser

- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
- Don't forget to adjust to your 'port', if you don't use ':3000'.
